Mindfulness meditation is about focusing on what is happening around you and being aware of your thoughts and feelings during the process of meditating. Your mind should be open to your true feelings &ndash; there should be no judging of your thoughts. This is a common practice that Buddhist monks use as a way of self-awakening. <br />

Compassion meditation produces a state in which love and compassion permeate the whole mind, with no other consideration, reasoning or discursive thoughts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Compassion meditation produces a very specific feeling &mdash; a caring for the well-being of another living being, independent of approving or disapproving of them, or expecting anything in return.&nbsp; Some report this feeling as a continuous aha! moment.<br />
