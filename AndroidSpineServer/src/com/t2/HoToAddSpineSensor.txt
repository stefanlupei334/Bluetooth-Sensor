	Example based on adding "ShimmerDevice"
	Assuming that this is a static device (one that doesn't report it's address to the spine server in discovery)
	Service:
		-Replicate functionality in one of the other devices (i.e. Neurosky Mindset)
			-Add new package in service for Shimmer - com.t2.biofeedback.shimmer
			-Add new files: StreamParser.java, ShimmerDevice.java, ShimmerBH.java, DataListener.java
			-In ShimmerDevice.Java, update source ID  (See SOURCE_ID_HIGH, and SOURCE_ID_LOW)
		-Update ShimmerDevice to handle incoming bluetooth byte stream, parse into messages
		 and send updates to listeners (mServerListeners.get(i).send(msg1);)
		-Add ShimmerBH to DeviceManager based on adapter name (d = new ShimmerBH(mServerListeners);)


	Server:
		-New file: spine.datamodel.ShimmerData (for device data format definition)
		-New file: spine.payload.codec.android.ShimmerSpineData (Codec for decoding newly created data format)
		-File SpineFunctionsConostants.java
			Add function type: SHIMMER = 0x0B; (This should match the definition in ShimmerDevice.java
			Add appropriate entries in functionCodeToString(), and functionCodeByString(), functionalityCodeToString()
		-Update com.t2.Constants.java to add a reserved address to match ID_HIGH, and SOURCE_ID_LOW added in the service
		-Update activity that will use this sensor
		  -Add shimmerNode to SpineManager activeNodes (Since the sensor doesn't automatically report on discovery)
